---+Build+---
In this directory run "ant" it builds OsmUi.jar!

Note: You can build the test classes with "ant build-tests" but this
is not recommended as it needs junit in your ant classpath use
the provided eclipse project instead or edit the build.xml
to make it more versatile, patches welcome!
---+Run+---
After having built run "java -jar OsmUi.jar" for further help look into
the online help provided in the application itself.
